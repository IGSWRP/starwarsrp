## Promotion Module

The Promotion Menu is opened using F2.

It shows players online recruits and other players in their regiment.

Players are able to promote and demote players if they are:

* CL2+
* Lower than their own rank
* In their regiment

### Promotion

* Increments their rank unless there is no higher rank available
* Sets recruits to Stormtrooper Private
* Checks and updates their model if they no longer have that model available
* Updates their Max HP

### Demotion

* Decreases their rank unless they are a recruit
* Strips any weapons they shouldn't have access to anymore
* Sets the player to recruit if they are the minimum rank (e.g. Private)
* Checks and updates their model if they no longer have that model available 
* Updates their Max HP

### Set Class

* Sets player to an available class in their regiment
* Must be CL3+ to set class

### Edit Player

* Available only to admins
* Allows admins to edit regiment, rank and class for a player 
* Used instead of promote, demote and set class for admins

Q: Why can admins not bypass the rank and regiment restrictions for demote and promote?

A: The idea is to keep promotions and demotions strictly in rp with the aim of logging it similar to RFAs.
